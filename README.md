# rename_multiple_files_from_csv
Can rename files in a folder based on a csv list\
.csv can be made with any excel program, just make sure to save as a simple csv (mac-specific csv may bug out)\
The program references two folders, 'rename_these_files", and after renaming a file moves it to 'renamed_files' folder\
So make sure you have both of those available to the program.
