Can rename files in a folder based on a csv list\
.csv can be made with any excel program, just make sure to save as a simple csv (mac-specific csv may bug out)\
The program will rename everything in the folder 'rename_these_files', can change what 'path' equals to suit your purposes\
Will also alert te user if a file in the .csv is not in the directory, or if a file in the directory is not in the .csv.
